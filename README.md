# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

A sorting algorithm visualizer is a tool or application that provides a graphical representation of how sorting algorithms work. Its primary purpose is to help users understand and observe the step-by-step process of sorting a collection of elements. The visualizer typically allows users to input a list of elements or generates a random set, and then it visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms rearrange these elements into a specific order.
